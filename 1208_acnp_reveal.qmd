## Precision Mental Health for Continuing Care 

To prevent relapse, SUD continuing care requires 

- Long-term monitoring 
- Ongoing lifestyle adjustments and supports

::: {.notes}
Decades of research has established that the risk factors that instigate lapses and relapse are complex, interactive, and non-linear.

These factors differ across individuals and are also dynamic within any specific individual over time.

Given this, continuing care for substance use disorders requires both long-term monitoring and ongoing lifestyle adjustments and supports

## Precision Mental Health for Continuing Care 

[To prevent relapse, SUD continuing care requires]{style="color: blue;"} 

- [Long-term monitoring]{style="color: blue;"} 
- [Ongoing lifestyle adjustments and support]{style="color: blue;"} 

\

A precision mental health approach can provide 

- the [right interventions and supports]{style="color: blue;"} 
- to the [right people]{style="color: blue;"} 
- at the [right time]{style="color: blue;"}, 
- [every time]{style="color: blue;"}

::: {.notes}
Essentially, effective continuing care requires a precision mental health approach that involves providing the **right interventions and supports** to the **right people** at the **right time**, **every time**

And this focus on the **right time** is particularly important for recovery for substance use disorders where the optimal supports for any specific individual can change month to month, day to day, and even from moment to moment.

## A Smart Recovery Monitoring and Support System

A "Smart" Recovery Monitoring and Support System can provide temporally precise, dynamic, personalized continuing care by combining:

  - Sensing
  - Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning

::: {.notes}
We believe we can harness and combine two technologies that are rapidly maturing, 

personal sensing and artificial intelligence algorithms, 

to develop a smart recovery monitoring and support system that can both predict lapses before they occur and provide personalized support and recommendations to patients about how to prevent those lapses from occurring.

## A Smart Recovery Monitoring and Support System

A "Smart" Recovery Monitoring and Support System can provide temporally precise, dynamic, personalized continuing care by combining:

  - Sensing
  - Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning

\

It can provide continuing care that is

- Cost effective,  
- Highly scalable,
- Available 24/7 to patients

::: {.notes}
Critically, this monitoring and support system is 

- cost effective,  
- highly scalable,
- and available 24/7 to patients

which can address many of the barriers to providing long-term continuing care

And what I'd like to do today is tell you a bit more about how the system works, what we have learned so far, and where we are going next.

## Personal Sensing

Personal sensing collects information from smartphones to identify a person's thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and context.

\

Sensing allows for "real-world" measurement that 

- Can be sustained for long periods
- Has very high temporal granularity 

::: {.notes}
First of all, lets talk briefly about the personal sensing inputs to our system.

Personal sensing is just a fancy term for methods that allow us to do real-world measurement of people's thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and context.  

These methods allow us to feasibly collect these inputs over very long periods of time from months to even years.

and we can collect these inputs with very high temporal granularity, at least several times per day and in some instances continuously

We focus on 

- Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
- Geolocation
- Smartphone communications (calls and texts)

::: {.notes}
At this point, we have worked extensively with a sensing method called ecological momentary assessment, or EMA for short, 

but I will also tell you about how we are expanding our sensing methods to include geolocation and smartphone communications data.

## Lapse Prediction for AUD

- 151 individuals with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder (AUD)

- Early in recovery (1-8 weeks)

- Committed to abstinence throughout study

- Followed with sensing for up to 3 months
  - Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
  - Geolocation
  - Smartphone Communications

::: {.notes}
As the first step toward developing this system, in 2020 we completed data collection we were awarded a large grant from the NIAAA to recruit a sample of individuals in early recovery from moderate to severe AUD.

We followed these individuals for up to three months, using our three sensing methods and also recording any lapses back to alcohol use.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)

- Current/Recent Experiences
  - Craving
  - Affect
  - Recent past alcohol use
  - Recent risky situations
  - Recent stressful events
  - Recent pleasant event

\

- Future Expectations
  - Risky situations
  - Stressful events
  - Abstinence Confidence

::: {.notes}
The first machine learning prediction models we developed used features from EMAs so let me tell you a bit more about this method.

These EMAs are brief surveys that participants completed on their smartphones.  They take 20-30 seconds to complete and we collected them several times per day.

Participants used these EMAs to report on their current experiences including their craving, affect, and recent alcohol use.  And they also let us know about future expected important events in the coming week and their confidence that they could remain abstinent.

## Model Predictions 

- Predict hour-by-hour probability of [future lapse]{style="color: blue;"}

\

- Lapse window widths
  - Next week 
  - Next day
  - Next hour 

::: {.notes}
We used features from these EMAs to train machine learning models that make predictions about the hour-by-hour probability of a future lapse.  

And we developed separate models for three future lapse windows – lapses in the next week, lapses in the next day, and lapses in the next hour.

## Model Predictions 

- Predict hour-by-hour probability of [future lapse]{style="color: blue;"}

\

- Lapse window widths
  - Next week 
  - Next day
  - Next hour 

::: {.notes}
For example, if I was in recovery, I could use these models to generate the probability that I would lapse after this symposium ends. The next week model would generate the probability I would lapse at some point between 5 pm today and 5 pm next Friday, the next day model would predict the probability that I would lapse between 5 pm today and 5 pm tomorrow and the most temporally precise next hour model would provide the probability that I would lapse between 5pm today and 6pm today.  

And of course, all of the models would only use data collected prior to 5 pm today so that they are “predicting”, in the full sense of the word, into the future and not just demonstrating an association.

## Model Performance

The Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (auROC) indicates the probability that any true lapse is scored higher than any true no-lapse by the model

- Random performance:  auROC = 0.5 
- Perfect performance: auROC = 1.0 


:::::{.callout-tip icon=false}
## Rules of thumb for auROC 
.70 - .80 is considered fair  
.80 - .90 is considered good  
\>= .90 is considered excellent  
:::::

::: {.notes}
We can evaluate the performance accuracy of these models using a metric called the auROC for short.  

- An auROC of .5 indicates a model whose accuracy is no better than random guessing, and 
- An auROC of 1.0 indicates perfect accuracy

And models with auROCs of .90 or higher are considered to have excellent performance.
