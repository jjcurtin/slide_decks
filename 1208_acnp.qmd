In 2022, 28 million adults in the US had an active alcohol use disorder.

As you can imagine, the economic and personal costs of this disorder, given both its impact and scale, are very high and I am sure that many of you have seen these some of these costs up close among your own family and friends.

::: {.notes}
Unfortunately, despite the high costs, we are exceeding poor at providing treatments for alcohol use disorders. 

In 2022, only 1 out of every 9 of those 28 million people suffering from an alcohol use disorder received any clinician delivered treatment.  That leaves almost 25 million people untreated in any given year.

And this is particularly sad because we do have several effective medications and psychosocial treatments available for alcohol and other substance use disorders.

[PAUSE]   

But as bad as it is for initial treatment, the story is even more bleak for continuing care.

There is no question that for many people, substance use disorders manifest as chronic relapsing conditions.  

We routinely provide monitoring and support for other chronic health conditions like diabetes and hypertension.  Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that very few people receive consistent continuing care after completing initial treatment for SUD.  And I say anecdotal evidence, because we do not pay enough attention to SUD continuing care for relapse prevention to even collect reliable data to estimate its rate.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Precision Mental Health for Continuing Care 

To prevent relapse, SUD continuing care requires 

- Long-term monitoring 
- Ongoing lifestyle adjustments and supports

::: {.notes}
Decades of research has established that the risk factors that instigate lapses and relapse are complex, interactive, and non-linear.

These factors differ across individuals and are also dynamic within any specific individual over time.

Given this, continuing care for substance use disorders requires both long-term monitoring and ongoing lifestyle adjustments and supports

[To prevent relapse, SUD continuing care requires]{style="color: blue;"} 

- [Long-term monitoring]{style="color: blue;"} 
- [Ongoing lifestyle adjustments and support]{style="color: blue;"} 

\

A precision mental health approach can provide 

- the [right interventions and supports]{style="color: blue;"} 
- to the [right people]{style="color: blue;"} 
- at the [right time]{style="color: blue;"}, 
- [every time]{style="color: blue;"}

::: {.notes}
Essentially, effective continuing care requires a precision mental health approach that involves providing the **right interventions and supports** to the **right people** at the **right time**, **every time**

And this focus on the **right time** is particularly important for recovery for substance use disorders where the optimal supports for any specific individual can change month to month, day to day, and even from moment to moment.

## A Smart Recovery Monitoring and Support System

A "Smart" Recovery Monitoring and Support System can provide temporally precise, dynamic, personalized continuing care by combining:

  - Sensing
  - Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning

::: {.notes}
We believe we can harness and combine two technologies that are rapidly maturing, 

personal sensing and artificial intelligence algorithms, 

to develop a smart recovery monitoring and support system that can both predict lapses before they occur and provide personalized support and recommendations to patients about how to prevent those lapses from occurring.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A Smart Recovery Monitoring and Support System

A "Smart" Recovery Monitoring and Support System can provide temporally precise, dynamic, personalized continuing care by combining:

  - Sensing
  - Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning

\

It can provide continuing care that is

- Cost effective,  
- Highly scalable,
- Available 24/7 to patients

::: {.notes}
Critically, this monitoring and support system is 

- cost effective,  
- highly scalable,
- and available 24/7 to patients

which can address many of the barriers to providing long-term continuing care

And what I'd like to do today is tell you a bit more about how the system works, what we have learned so far, and where we are going next.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Personal Sensing

Personal sensing collects information from smartphones to identify a person's thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and context.

\

Sensing allows for "real-world" measurement that 

- Can be sustained for long periods
- Has very high temporal granularity 

::: {.notes}
First of all, lets talk briefly about the personal sensing inputs to our system.

Personal sensing is just a fancy term for methods that allow us to do real-world measurement of people's thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and context.  

These methods allow us to feasibly collect these inputs over very long periods of time from months to even years.

and we can collect these inputs with very high temporal granularity, at least several times per day and in some instances continuously

\

We focus on 

- Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
- Geolocation
- Smartphone communications (calls and texts)

::: {.notes}
At this point, we have worked extensively with a sensing method called ecological momentary assessment, or EMA for short, 

but I will also tell you about how we are expanding our sensing methods to include geolocation and smartphone communications data.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lapse Prediction for AUD

- 151 individuals with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder (AUD)

- Early in recovery (1-8 weeks)

- Committed to abstinence throughout study

- Followed with sensing for up to 3 months
  - Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
  - Geolocation
  - Smartphone Communications

\

![](https://github.com/jjcurtin/slide_decks/blob/main/images/risk1_pi_wide.png?raw=true){.absolute bottom=0}

::: {.notes}
As the first step toward developing this system, in 2020 we completed data collection we were awarded a large grant from the NIAAA to recruit a sample of individuals in early recovery from moderate to severe AUD.

We followed these individuals for up to three months, using our three sensing methods and also recording any lapses back to alcohol use.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)

- Current/Recent Experiences
  - Craving
  - Affect
  - Recent past alcohol use
  - Recent risky situations
  - Recent stressful events
  - Recent pleasant event

\

- Future Expectations
  - Risky situations
  - Stressful events
  - Abstinence Confidence

![](https://github.com/jjcurtin/slide_decks/blob/main/images/ema_hand.png?raw=true){.absolute bottom=0 right=50 width=45%}

::: {.notes}
The first machine learning prediction models we developed used features from EMAs so let me tell you a bit more about this method.

These EMAs are brief surveys that participants completed on their smartphones.  They take 20-30 seconds to complete and we collected them several times per day.

Participants used these EMAs to report on their current experiences including their craving, affect, and recent alcohol use.  And they also let us know about future expected important events in the coming week and their confidence that they could remain abstinent.

## Model Predictions 

- Predict hour-by-hour probability of [future lapse]{style="color: blue;"}

\

- Lapse window widths
  - Next week 
  - Next day
  - Next hour 

::: {.notes}
We used features from these EMAs to train machine learning models that make predictions about the hour-by-hour probability of a future lapse.  

And we developed separate models for three future lapse windows – lapses in the next week, lapses in the next day, and lapses in the next hour.  
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Model Predictions 

- Predict hour-by-hour probability of [future lapse]{style="color: blue;"}

\

- Lapse window widths
  - Next week 
  - Next day
  - Next hour 

::: {.notes}
For example, if I was in recovery, I could use these models to generate the probability that I would lapse after this symposium ends. The next week model would generate the probability I would lapse at some point between 5 pm today and 5 pm next Friday, the next day model would predict the probability that I would lapse between 5 pm today and 5 pm tomorrow and the most temporally precise next hour model would provide the probability that I would lapse between 5pm today and 6pm today.  

And of course, all of the models would only use data collected prior to 5 pm today so that they are “predicting”, in the full sense of the word, into the future and not just demonstrating an association.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Model Performance

The Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (auROC) indicates the probability that any true lapse is scored higher than any true no-lapse by the model

- Random performance:  auROC = 0.5 
- Perfect performance: auROC = 1.0 


:::::{.callout-tip icon=false}
## Rules of thumb for auROC 
.70 - .80 is considered fair  
.80 - .90 is considered good  
\>= .90 is considered excellent  
:::::

::: {.notes}
We can evaluate the performance accuracy of these models using a metric called the auROC for short.  

- An auROC of .5 indicates a model whose accuracy is no better than random guessing, and 
- An auROC of 1.0 indicates perfect accuracy

And models with auROCs of .90 or higher are considered to have excellent performance.

and our one hour model had the highest performance of all with an auROC of 0.93. 

Candidly, we hadn't anticipated that we could do this well with such high levels of temporal precision.  

But we can, and to be clear, we believe all three of these models to have clinically implementable levels of performance such that we can use them to make meaningful decisions for individual participants at specific moments in time.

But we can get much more than just lapse probabilities from these models. 

Using SHAP values, we can understand which features contributed most strongly to any prediction for a specific person at a specific moment in time.  This allows us to understand not only WHEN a lapse might occur but also WHY and potentially how best to intervene. 

For example, in this first plot,  I am showing you someone who would be predicted to have a high lapse probability on day 30 of their recovery because they have been reporting high craving.  For that person, we could recommend urge surfing techniques or remind them that distracting activities can help get them through short periods of craving.

In contrast, a second person might have similarly high lapse probability on day 30 of their recovery, but instead because they have lapsed a few times in recent weeks. They could be encouraged and assisted to complete activities designed to increase their motivation for abstinence.

And at a later point in time, that same person may have improved their abstinence motivation but now be at increased risk for a lapse because of a string of recent past and anticipated stressors.   

Now they could be provided with guided stress reduction or relaxation techniques that they could use each day.  

In this way, we can provide personalized recommendations to patients that are tailored to their unique risk profile at that moment in time.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Beyond Prediction: Personalized Recommendations 

- Sensing EMA and geolocation for six months
- Model updated each night (4 am) for next day
  - Lapse probability prediction
  - Recent trend in lapse probability
  - Important risk features
  - Risk relevant support recommendation
  
- Participants receive daily messages varying combinations of these components

- Measure trust, utility, engagement, and clinical outcomes

Grant funded in September 2024

![](https://github.com/jjcurtin/slide_decks/blob/main/images/opt_pi_wide.png?raw=true){.absolute bottom=0}

::: {.notes}
And that brings us to perhaps the most important next step.

Just because our prediction models perform well, doesn't guarantee that they will provide meaningful clinical benefits.

We need to be able to provide feedback from these models to patients such that they trust the system, find it useful, and engage with it over time in a way that improves their recovery.

And we were just awarded another grant from the NIAAA to do exactly this.  

In this project, we will be using a model with inputs from both EMA and geolocation.  We will use the model to make 

- daily lapse probability predictions, 
- identify current personalized lapse risks, 
- and map those risks to behavioral and support recommendations that are specific to each person each day.   

We can then manipulate what information we include in daily messages from the system to participants to increase their trust and engagement with the system as well as formally evaluating its clinical benefits.

Obviously, we are very excited to get started on this project because it will bring us one step closer to providing meaningful support to individuals in recovery.   

Thanks for your time, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have now or later at the end of this session.

But not surprisingly, there are still a number of very important issues to address before we can implement this system.

The first issue is to assure that the models in our system are fair when used with individuals from different subgroups that have historically been disadvantaged in mental healthcare.

As one example of this issue, the data we collected to train these models from this first grant did not include much racial and ethnic diversity among the participants.

## Next Steps: Algorithmic Fairness

- NIDA project is recruiting ~ 400 patients in recovery from Opioid Use Disorder 
- [National sample (size; diversity: demographics, location)]{style="color: blue;"}
- More variation in stage of recovery (1 – 6 months at start)
- Sensing for 12 months

\

Data collection will finish in December 2024

![](https://github.com/jjcurtin/slide_decks/blob/main/images/risk2_pi_wide.png?raw=true){.absolute bottom=0}

::: {.notes}
For example, we have been awarded a grant from NIDA to collect a more racially diverse sample using nationwide recruiting techniques.  

This sample will also include much needed geographic diversity because the factors that predict lapse in urban settings may be different from those that predict lapse in rural settings.

## Next Steps: Sensing Geolocation and Communcations

::: {.notes}

[PAUSE]

Next up.... as our monitoring and support system continues to mature, we will want a richer, broader set of lapse risk features so that we can distinguish better between different situations that require different supports. 

We can do this by engineering features from our location and communication signals, which tap into different experiences than what we measure by EMA.

::: {.notes}
To give you taste of the power for these novel signals, here is a wide view of my moment-by-moment location detected by a GPS app over a month when we were first experimenting with this sensing method.  The app recorded the paths that I traveled, with movement by car in green and running in blue.

The red dots indicate places that I stopped to visit for at least a few minutes.

And although not displayed here, the app recorded the days and exact times that I was at each of these locations.

From these data, you can immediately see that I am runner, with long runs leaving from downtown Madison and frequent trail runs on the weekends in the county and state parks to the west and northwest.

::: {.notes}
Zooming in to the Madison isthmus, these data show that I drove my children halfway around the lake each morning to their elementary school.  And from these data we might be able to detect those stressful mornings when getting my young kids dressed and fed didn't go as planned and we were late, sometimes **very late**, to school!

The app recorded my daily running commute through downtown Madison to and from my office.  From this, we can observe my longs days at the office and also those days that I skipped out.

Looking at the red dots indicating the places I visit, the system can detect the restaurants, bars, and coffee shops where I eat, drink and socialize.  We can use public map data to identify these places and make inferences about what I do there.

[PAUSE]

Both geolocation and communications data are powerful sensed signals that we have already begun to use to predict lapse risk with success.

And we plan to implement a model with both EMA and geolocation for a new project that we are just launching now.
