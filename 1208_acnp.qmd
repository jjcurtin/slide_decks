::: {.notes}
About a decade ago I was approaching the middle of my career.  I had developed a successful basic clinical science research program as a psychophysiologist running experiments to understand the effects of drugs and drug withdrawal on stress.  The work was intellectually stimulating, we were publishing it in good outlets, and we were getting grants, but my heart was increasingly not in it.

I'd become a clinical psychologist to help people struggling with alcohol and other SUDs.  

- My paternal grandmother died of complications secondary to alcoholism. 

- My dad has struggled with his use of alcohol for his entire adult life and during periods where he lost control it affected all of us.

- My cousin, Stephen, has a severe substance use disorder and has been incarcerated several times for drug related offenses.  He has had periods of stability but they have always ended in another relapse.  

My Aunt Cathy and Stephen's brother, Colin, had reached out to me on numerous occasions to ask what could be done to help Stephen.  

And it was those conversations that really got me thinking about how I could re-direct my research program to help people like Stephen and my dad and my grandmother.

## A Smart Recovery Monitoring and Support System

::: {.notes}
It was around that time that Dave Gustafson reached out to me.  Dave directs a center on campus that develops digital therapeutics for substance use disorders.  These are essentially smartphone apps that provide ongoing continuing care for patients during their recovery.  He had just completed a large randomized controlled trial demonstrating that his app meaningfully decreased heavy drinking days and increased abstinence rates over the first year of recovery. 

However, he also noticed many of the people who had relapsed hadn't used the app in the days leading up to that relapse.  And others who had relapsed hadn't used the specific supports in the app that he would have thought would be most effective for them.

::: {.notes}
Dave knew that we were exploring the factors that motivated alcohol and other drug use and he asked us a simple question: 

"Could you predict not only who might be at greatest risk for relapse but precisely when that relapse might occur and how best to intervene to prevent it"


... because if we could develop a system to do this, he could embed it into his app to guide people to the most effective supports at the most critical moments in their recovery.

## A Smart Recovery Monitoring and Support System

- Precision mental health requires us to provide the [right interventions]{style="color: blue;"} and supports to the <br>[right people]{style="color: blue;"} at the [right time]{style="color: blue;"}, [every time]{style="color: blue;"}

\

- Continuing care for substance use disorders requires [long-term monitoring]{style="color: blue;"} and <br>[ongoing lifestyle adjustments and support]{style="color: blue;"} to prevent relapse

::: {.notes}
These questions that Dave was asking are at the heart of what we now call precision mental health.  How can we provide the **right interventions and supports** to the **right people** at the **right time**, **every time**

And this focus on the **right time** is particularly important for recovery from substance use disorders.  Substance use disorders are chronic relapsing conditions and therefore successful recovery requires lifelong monitoring and support to prevent relapse.  

And, critically, the optimal supports for any specific individual can change month to month, day to day, and even from moment to moment.

\

- [Continuing care for substance use disorders requires long-term monitoring and <br>ongoing lifestyle adjustments and support to prevent relapse]{style="color:gray;"}

\

- A "Smart" Recovery Monitoring and Support System can provide temporally precise, dynamic, personalized continuing care by combining:
  - Sensing
  - Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning

::: {.notes}
We believed that we could harness and combine two technologies that were emerging at that time, 

personal sensing and artificial intelligence algorithms, 

to develop a smart recovery monitoring and support system that could both predict lapses before they occurred and provide personalized support and recommendations to patients about how to prevent those lapses from occurring.

And what I'd like to do today is tell you a bit more about how we are doing this, what we have learned so far, and where we are going next with this system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Personal Sensing

Personal sensing collects information from smartphones to identify a person's thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and context.

\

Sensing allows for "real-world" measurement that 

- Can be sustained for long periods
- Has very high temporal granularity 

::: {.notes}
First of all, lets talk briefly about the personal sensing inputs to our system.

Personal sensing is just a fancy term for methods that allow us to do real-world measurement of people's thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and context.  

These methods allow us to feasibly collect these inputs over very long periods of time from months to even years.

and we can collect these inputs with very high temporal granularity, at least several times per day and in some instances continuously

\

We focus on 

- Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
- Geolocation
- Smartphone communications (calls and texts)

::: {.notes}
At this point, we have worked extensively with a sensing method called ecological momentary assessment, or EMA for short, 

but I will also tell you about how we are expanding our sensing methods to include geolocation and smartphone communications data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Lapse Prediction for AUD

- 151 individuals with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder (AUD)

- Early in recovery (1-8 weeks)

- Committed to abstinence throughout study

- Followed with sensing for up to 3 months
  - Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
  - Geolocation
  - Smartphone Communications

\

![](https://github.com/jjcurtin/slide_decks/blob/main/images/risk1_pi_wide.png?raw=true){.absolute bottom=0}

::: {.notes}
As the first step toward developing this system, in 2016 we were awarded a large grant from the NIAAA to recruit a sample of individuals in early recovery from moderate to severe AUD.

We followed these individuals for up to three months, using our three sensing methods and also recording any lapses back to alcohol use.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)

- Current/Recent Experiences
  - Craving
  - Affect
  - Recent past alcohol use
  - Recent risky situations
  - Recent stressful events
  - Recent pleasant event

\

- Future Expectations
  - Risky situations
  - Stressful events
  - Abstinence Confidence

![](https://github.com/jjcurtin/slide_decks/blob/main/images/ema_hand.png?raw=true){.absolute bottom=0 right=50 width=45%}

::: {.notes}
The first machine learning prediction models we developed used features from EMAs so let me tell you a bit more about this method.

These EMAs are brief surveys that participants completed on their smartphones.  They take 20-30 seconds to complete and we collected them several times per day.

Participants used these EMAs to report on their current experiences including their craving, affect, and recent alcohol use.  And they also let us know about future expected important events in the coming week and their confidence that they could remain abstinent.

## Model Predictions 

- Predict hour-by-hour probability of [future lapse]{style="color: blue;"}

\

- Lapse window widths
  - Next week 
  - Next day
  - Next hour 

::: {.notes}
We used features from these EMAs to train machine learning models that make predictions about the hour-by-hour probability of a future lapse.  

And we developed separate models for three future lapse windows – lapses in the next week, lapses in the next day, and lapses in the next hour.  
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Model Predictions 

- Predict hour-by-hour probability of [future lapse]{style="color: blue;"}

\

- Lapse window widths
  - Next week 
  - Next day
  - Next hour 

::: {.notes}
For example, if I was in recovery, I could use these models to generate the probability that I would lapse after this symposium ends. The next week model would generate the probability I would lapse at some point between 5 pm today and 5 pm next Friday, the next day model would predict the probability that I would lapse between 5 pm today and 5 pm tomorrow and the most temporally precise next hour model would provide the probability that I would lapse between 5pm today and 6pm today.  

And of course, all of the models would only use data collected prior to 5 pm today so that they are “predicting”, in the full sense of the word, into the future and not just demonstrating an association.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Model Performance

The Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (auROC) indicates the probability that any true lapse is scored higher than any true no-lapse by the model

- Random performance:  auROC = 0.5 
- Perfect performance: auROC = 1.0 


:::::{.callout-tip icon=false}
## Rules of thumb for auROC 
.70 - .80 is considered fair  
.80 - .90 is considered good  
\>= .90 is considered excellent  
:::::

::: {.notes}
We can evaluate the performance accuracy of these models using a metric called the auROC for short.  

- An auROC of .5 indicates a model whose accuracy is no better than random guessing, and 
- An auROC of 1.0 indicates perfect accuracy

And models with auROCs of .90 or higher are considered to have excellent performance.

and our one hour model had the highest performance of all with an auROC of 0.93. 

Candidly, we hadn't anticipated that we could do this well with such high levels of temporal precision.  

But we can, and to be clear, we believe all three of these models to have clinically implementable levels of performance such that we can use them to make meaningful decisions for individual participants at specific moments in time.

But we can get much more than just lapse probabilities from these models. 

Using SHAP values, we can understand which features contributed most strongly to any prediction for a specific person at a specific moment in time.  This allows us to understand not only WHEN a lapse might occur but also WHY and potentially how best to intervene. 

For example, in this first plot,  I am showing you someone who would be predicted to have a high lapse probability on day 30 of their recovery because they have been reporting high craving.  For that person, we could recommend urge surfing techniques or remind them that distracting activities can help get them through short periods of craving.

In contrast, a second person might have similarly high lapse probability on day 30 of their recovery, but instead because they have lapsed a few times in recent weeks. They could be encouraged and assisted to complete activities designed to increase their motivation for abstinence.

And at a later point in time, that same person may have improved their abstinence motivation but now be at increased risk for a lapse because of a string of recent past and anticipated stressors.   

Now they could be provided with guided stress reduction or relaxation techniques that they could use each day.  

In this way, we can provide personalized recommendations to patients that are tailored to their unique risk profile at that moment in time.
:::

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Beyond Prediction: Personalized Recommendations 

- Sensing EMA and geolocation for six months
- Model updated each night (4 am) for next day
  - Lapse probability prediction
  - Recent trend in lapse probability
  - Important risk features
  - Risk relevant support recommendation
  
- Participants receive daily messages varying combinations of these components

- Measure trust, utility, engagement, and clinical outcomes

Grant funded in September 2024

![](https://github.com/jjcurtin/slide_decks/blob/main/images/opt_pi_wide.png?raw=true){.absolute bottom=0}

::: {.notes}
And that brings us to perhaps the most important next step.

Just because our prediction models perform well, doesn't guarantee that they will provide meaningful clinical benefits.

We need to be able to provide feedback from these models to patients such that they trust the system, find it useful, and engage with it over time in a way that improves their recovery.

And we were just awarded another grant from the NIAAA to do exactly this.  

In this project, we will be using a model with inputs from both EMA and geolocation.  We will use the model to make 

- daily lapse probability predictions, 
- identify current personalized lapse risks, 
- and map those risks to behavioral and support recommendations that are specific to each person each day.   

We can then manipulate what information we include in daily messages from the system to participants to increase their trust and engagement with the system as well as formally evaluating its clinical benefits.

Obviously, we are very excited to get started on this project because it will bring us one step closer to providing meaningful support to individuals in recovery.   

Thanks for your time, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have now or later at the end of this session.

But not surprisingly, there are still a number of very important issues to address before we can implement this system.

The first issue is to assure that the models in our system are fair when used with individuals from different subgroups that have historically been disadvantaged in mental healthcare.

As one example of this issue, the data we collected to train these models from this first grant did not include much racial and ethnic diversity among the participants.

## Next Steps: Algorithmic Fairness

- NIDA project is recruiting ~ 400 patients in recovery from Opioid Use Disorder 
- [National sample (size; diversity: demographics, location)]{style="color: blue;"}
- More variation in stage of recovery (1 – 6 months at start)
- Sensing for 12 months

\

Data collection will finish in December 2024

![](https://github.com/jjcurtin/slide_decks/blob/main/images/risk2_pi_wide.png?raw=true){.absolute bottom=0}

::: {.notes}
For example, we have been awarded a grant from NIDA to collect a more racially diverse sample using nationwide recruiting techniques.  

This sample will also include much needed geographic diversity because the factors that predict lapse in urban settings may be different from those that predict lapse in rural settings.

## Next Steps: Sensing Geolocation and Communcations

::: {.notes}

[PAUSE]

Next up.... as our monitoring and support system continues to mature, we will want a richer, broader set of lapse risk features so that we can distinguish better between different situations that require different supports. 

We can do this by engineering features from our location and communication signals, which tap into different experiences than what we measure by EMA.

::: {.notes}
To give you taste of the power for these novel signals, here is a wide view of my moment-by-moment location detected by a GPS app over a month when we were first experimenting with this sensing method.  The app recorded the paths that I traveled, with movement by car in green and running in blue.

The red dots indicate places that I stopped to visit for at least a few minutes.

And although not displayed here, the app recorded the days and exact times that I was at each of these locations.

From these data, you can immediately see that I am runner, with long runs leaving from downtown Madison and frequent trail runs on the weekends in the county and state parks to the west and northwest.

::: {.notes}
Zooming in to the Madison isthmus, these data show that I drove my children halfway around the lake each morning to their elementary school.  And from these data we might be able to detect those stressful mornings when getting my young kids dressed and fed didn't go as planned and we were late, sometimes **very late**, to school!

The app recorded my daily running commute through downtown Madison to and from my office.  From this, we can observe my longs days at the office and also those days that I skipped out.

Looking at the red dots indicating the places I visit, the system can detect the restaurants, bars, and coffee shops where I eat, drink and socialize.  We can use public map data to identify these places and make inferences about what I do there.

[PAUSE]

Both geolocation and communications data are powerful sensed signals that we have already begun to use to predict lapse risk with success.

And we plan to implement a model with both EMA and geolocation for a new project that we are just launching now.
