Precision mental health involves providing the right treatments to the right people at the right time, every time.  First, we provide a framework for the use of personal sensing and machine learning algorithms embedded within digital therapeutics to achieve this goal for individuals with substance use disorders.  Next, we report preliminary findings from the use of this approach to identify when and how to intervene to prevent the return to alcohol use among individuals in recovery from alcohol use disorder.  We also demonstrate how similar algorithms can be used outside of a digital therapeutic.  We conclude by highlighting key next steps for the evaluation and implementation of this approach more generally.
